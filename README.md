The purpose of our application is gathering people of same nationalities (mostly targeting international students) who are undergoing difficulties adjusting to new college environment. Although our main focus is to help freshman students, we wanted to stretch this goal to embrace upperclassmen who did not have an opportunity to meet their people. To accomplish our goal, we are trying to get the students together based on the courses that each student are taking.
